# DataClassifier
From https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/, I was interested in the New_York_City_Leading_Causes_of_Death dataset in New York City. 
Evaluating accuracy against a test set, and then trying to improve accuracy! Defining death features and preparing data info to input into the classifier to get required results from the Cause of death related to Age, Sex, and Race.

Accuracy between 45-54% 
An example 
Classifier for (Age:'17.6', Sex: F', Race:'Black Non-Hispanic')
Cause of Death: Cerebrovascular Disease (Stroke: I60-I69)
